  abstract = {Dual infections of Lymnaea truncatula with Paramphistomum daubneyi and Fasciola hepatica were performed to determine whether temperature changes in snails (daily water change with spring water at 6°–8\,°C, which subsequently increased to room temperature at 20\,°C) would influence snail infection and the production of cercariae by both trematodes. At day 30 postexposure the surviving snails were individually placed in petri dishes to constitute two groups. Snails from the first group were maintained at a temperature of 20\,°C, and the water in the petri dishes was changed daily. The protocol was identical for the second group of snails except that the water temperature was 6°–8\,°C when changed. The interval between exposure and the first shedding of cercariae in snails immersed in cold water for a short period was longer (67–69 days instead of 48–50 days in the 20\,°C group). In both groups, snails infected only with F.\,hepatica or P.\,daubneyi or with both trematodes were detected. In snails infected only with F.\,hepatica the frequency of cercaria-shedding snails and the total number of metacercariae were significantly greater in the 20\,°C group. Inversely, in snails infected only with P.\,daubneyi the frequency of cercaria-shedding snails and the number of metacercariae were significantly greater in the 6°–8\,°C group. In snails harboring both trematode larval forms, no significant difference in the frequencies of cercaria-shedding snails between the two groups was noted. Metacercariae of both trematodes were obtained from these snails. In the 20\,°C group, F.\,hepatica metacercariae were more numerous, whereas in the 6°–8\,°C group the number of P.\,daubneyi metacercariae was greater. From these results it appears that greater activity of P.\,daubneyi cercariae occurs in snails subjected to daily temperature changes (from 6° to 20\,°C).},

Changing temperature experiments were carried out to determine whether these conditions had any extra effect on development. In three out of the four experiments with the eggs a significant accelerating effect on development was found and no effect was recorded in the fourth. The length of life of the miracidia was measured at various constant temperatures. With the larval stages in the snail Lymnaea truncatula no cercariæ were formed at 10°C but several generations of daughter rediæ were recorded. On the other hand, no daughter rediæ were found at temperatures of 25°C and over. Two changing temperature experiments were carried out and it was found that these conditions had no significant accelerating or retarding effect on development to release of the cercariæ. The significance of the results is discussed in the light of the development of forecasting models using climatic variables.},

  abstract = {Parasitic helminths mainly use carbohydrates for energy synthesis, of which glycogen is the main reserve polysaccharide. When its content decreases to the minimum value, helminths lose their invasive capability. The material for the research was F. hepatica metacercariae. The complete biological cycle of F. hepatica development, from incubation of adult helminth eggs to production of sexually mature trematodes in definitive hosts was reproduced in laboratory conditions using common methods of parasitic helminth cultivation. F. hepatica metacercariae were kept in petri dishes with distilled water on the leaves of Elytrigia repens under different temperature conditions. In experimental conditions, we observed a high stability of F. hepatica metacercariae. Their long-term storage at a constant temperature of 6\,±\,2\,° C causes a gradual decrease in the biological properties of F. hepatica metacercariae: viability, invasive capability and glycogen concentration. The glycogen concentration from 0.115 to 0.061\,μg in a metacercaria ensures the preservation of basic biological properties of the helminth. An increase in ambient temperature (38\,±\,2\,° C) or freezing temperatures (-2\,±\,2\,° C) cause a sharp decrease in the viability, the invasive capability and glycogen content. The invasive material becomes sterile after 72\,h under high (38\,±\,2\,° C) temperature conditions, and 96 days under freezing (-2\,±\,2\,° C) conditions.},

At 15 C, the growth rate was comparatively higher and the snails survived for a few more days. But at these temperatures they failed to attain sexual maturity. Snails exposed to pH 5 and 9 at 20, 25, 30, 35 C and room temperatures (19.6 -29.6 C); to 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 NaCl at 20 and 35 C; to 2.5 NaCl at 25 C and room temperatures failed to attain sexual maturity.

In order to clarify the taxonomy of these snails, a study was made of 61 populations from 42 localities in New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania, and some specimens forwarded by several collaborators in New Zealand. Two extreme morphological types, “A” and “B,” were recognized, and both serve as intermediate hosts for F.hepatica. Snails collected in the field showed great variations in shell and body and there were many intermediates between the extreme variants. In the assessment of various factors influencing the epidemiology and control of fascioliasis because of F. hepatica or F. gigantica, it should be assumed that all lymnaeid snails may aestivate for a considerable time during dry periods at both low and high temperatures. Empirical screening for new and more efficient anthelmintics against F. hepatica has been fairly successful, but has still failed to produce the ideal drug for safe, economic, and preventive medication of fascioliasis. More knowledge on the intermediary metabolism of F. hepatica, particularly of enzyme activity in the pathways, may lead to a new revolutionary approach for selecting a substance for the elimination of the parasites.},

Eggs developed in the dark under constant temperature failed to hatch, while eggs subjected to temperature changes of 4°C or more sometimes hatched even in the absence of light. With eggs subjected to temperature changes, hatching was invariably higher upon lowering than upon raising of the temperature, and under illumination than in the dark. Fastest development of the eggs occurred at 24°C-28°C, but maximal hatching was at 16°C-20°C. There were no marked differences in the hatching at various wavelengths of the visible-light spectrum or at different light intensities. These findings suggest that: (a) temperatures above 20°C are not conducive to hatching; (b) while light stimulates greater hatching, temperature changes, especially lowering of the temperature, are the main stimulus for massive hatching, and (c) wavelength of the light is of little significance to the hatching.},

Generally the infection rate rose with increasing temperatures up to 24°C and diminished with further elevation of temperature: it was highest in L. truncatula between 16°C and 24°C, in L. columella at 20°C and in L. tomentosa and L. cubensis at 24°C.

Growth, production of egg and shedding of metacercariae were monitored. Growth rate was reduced by about 19\% in the infected snails relative to the uninfected control. Eggs were produced by the infected and uninfected control snails. However, it was observed that some of the masses produced by the infected snails did not contain eggs. Metacercariae production was found to suppress egg production. A negative linear relationship was discovered to exist between growth rate and metacercariae production with the latter being responsible for a 7\% reduction in the growth of snails. These findings confirmed the fact that the parasite has a negative effect on the snail-host. However contrary to earlier observations, infected snails produced eggs although at a reduced rate. The present findings have provideda new insight into the dynamics of F. gigantic snail-host interactions},

  abstract = {Studies on the ecology of Lymnaea tomentosa and L. columella were carried out to provide a basis for further studies on the ecology of Fasciola hepatica infections in New Zealand. Intermediate hosts of F. hepatica in New Zealand are the native Australasian species L. tomentosa, an introduced American snail L. columella, and the European host L. truncatula. The literature on the systematics, geographical distribution, general biology and ecology of these snails, together with their relationships with F. hepatica, is reviewed. Field observations on snail habitats indicated that L. columella occupied ponds and spring fed marshes which remained wet even in dry seasons. L. tomentosa was found in similar marsh habitats. Stability appeared to be an important quality of the habitats of both species; factors unfavourable to the snails included rapidly flowing water, marked seasonal fluctuations in water level, and shade from tall vegetation. The calcium content of water in habitats ranged from 4 to 70 ppm. Snails were more often found on flocculent than on firm mud and this preference was more marked in the case of L. tomentosa. Snail population dynamics were examined on one pond habitat and three marsh habitats of L. columella and a marsh habitat of L. tomentosa. Age structure and density of populations fluctuated widely between and within each of the five years of the study. These changes were greater in populations of L. columella and not directly related to rainfall or temperature variations. Field and laboratory evidence showed that both species could breed throughout the year even when temperatures were as low as 5°C but populations were much larger in summer and early autumn. Studies of the fecundity of the two snail species and the relationship between temperature and rate of development of eggs showed that whilst L. columella has a higher adult mortality rate it also has a much greater reproductive potential than L. tomentosa. Eggs of L. columella develop over a wider range of temperatures, hatching up to 34.5°C whereas temperatures above 30°C are lethal to eggs of L. tomentosa. Eggs of both species underwent some development at temperatures between 5 and 10°C but the proportion that hatched at low temperatures was very small, particularly in the case of L. tomentosa. Both species showed similar responses to desiccation on filter paper at 16.5°C and 80 to 90\% relative humidity; survival time was closely related to shell length, with large snails considerably more resistant than smaller specimens. When snails were subjected to desiccation on mud results were much less predictable and the mean shell length of survivors was often less than that of snails which died. A biometric analysis of shell shape showed distinct differences between large specimens of L. tomentosa and L. columella but shell dimension ratios were not diagnostic in specimens under 4 mm in length. Examination of a pond and a marsh population of L. columella showed no differences in shell shape attributable to habitats. Over a 5 year period there was no detectable relationship between the intensity of F. hepatica transmission from a L. columella habitat and snail population density. The only correlation between F. hepatica transmission and rainfall was a possible inverse relationship between uptake in tracer sheep and December/January (mid-summer) rainfall. There was no evidence of any overwintering infection of F. hepatica infection in L. columella. Uptake of flukes by tracer sheep was almost totally confined to the period between mid-summer and mid-winter. Both experimental and circumstantial evidence indicated that pugging by cattle rendered marsh habitats more suitable for snails, although exclusion of cattle from the experimental area coincided with an increase in the uptake of F. hepatica by tracer sheep.},

  abstract = {Temperature affects the physiology and life-history of ectothermic animals, often increasing metabolic rate and decreasing body size. Oxygen limitation has been put forward as a mechanism to explain thermal responses of body size and the ability to survive stress. However the time-scales involved in growth performance and heat tolerance differ radically. In order to increase our understanding of oxygen and temperature effects on body size and heat tolerance and the time scale involved, we reared Lymnaea stagnalis under six combinations of temperature and oxygen tension from hatching up to an age of 300 days and recorded shell length during this whole period. At the end of this period, we determined scope for growth by measuring food intake rate, assimilation efficiency, respiration rate and ammonium excretion rate at two different temperatures. We also measured the snails’ ability to survive heat stress (CTmax), both at normoxia and hypoxia. We found that scope for growth and long term growth performance were much more affected by interactions of chronic oxygen and temperature conditions during rearing than by acute conditions during testing. Furthermore, our study shows that individual variation in growth performance can be traced back to individual differences in rates of food and oxygen consumption. Developmental acclimation also gave rise to differences in CTmax, but these were relatively small and were only expressed when CTmax was tested under hypoxia. The large effects of rearing oxygen conditions on growth and other physiological rates compared to modest effects of test oxygen conditions on CTmax suggest that small effects of hypoxia on the short term (e.g. heat tolerance) may nevertheless have large repercussions on the long term (e.g. growth and reproduction), even in a pulmonate snail that can compensate for hypoxia to some extent by aerial respiration.},

The effect of pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide, light/dark period and clean/polluted water on the fecundity, hatchability and survival of young snails of L. acuminata were studied. It was observed that these environmental variant abiotic factors caused a significant variation in fecundity, hatchability and survival of young snails. Maximum reproduction of this snail was observed in the months of March to May. A significant positive correlation (p\&lt;0.05) between D.O. (3.1–7.7\,ppm)/pH (7.01–8.96) of water with fecundity (6.0–196.33/20 snails), hatchability (54.69–96.91\%) and survival (61.3–95.86\%) of young snails was observed for each month and each interval of 24–72\,h. In contrast, a significant negative correlation between dissolved CO2 (4.6–16.6\,ppm)/temperature (16–37°C) of water was noted with fecundity, hatchability and survival of snails. Percent hatchability in the eggs in different regimens of water was between 96.91–54.69\%. The hatching period was prolonged (2–14 days) in snail exposed to different groups of water compared to the control group (2–9\,d).

  abstract = {Species of Fasciola are characterized by broad flat bodies, closely approximated suckers (the ventral larger than the oral), and the possession of a conical process at the tip of which, the mouth is situated. There is enormous variation in size depending on factors such as the age of the fluke, the species of host in which it is found, the weight of infection, and the way in which the fluke has been fixed. Species of Fasciola have a very wide range of possible definitive hosts but in practice, they are usually maintained by ungulates and, in the case of F. hepatica, by rabbits. Sheep are very efficient hosts of F. hepatica and the water buffalo is perhaps the best host for F. gigantic. The coypu (Myocaster coypus) has been recognized as a host of F. hepatica in certain areas where the fluke had previously been considered to be relatively uncommon, because the habitats of domestic animals and the intermediate host did not coincide. The coypu may prove to be too susceptible to the pathogenic effects of infection to be a satisfactory host. The efficacy of the mammalian host is the resultant of a number of factors of which, the grazing habit is one and the susceptibility to infection is another. Small mammals often die but some larger hosts may develop cirrhotic livers and allow very few fertile fluke eggs to escape on to the pasture. The snails serving as intermediate hosts of Fasciola include some that are essentially amphibious and others that are more aquatic.},

Different vectors of FascioIa hepatica and Fasciola gigantica are discussed in this chapter. Lymnaea tomentosa (L. tomentosa) is found to be the only vector of Fasciola that is tolerant to a wide range of temperatures and resistant to low temperatures. Under specific conditions, the areas where cattle and L. natalensis occur together are fairly restricted and the grazing habits of the local breeds of sheep and goats are not likely to put them in major danger. Miracidia takes longer to penetrate L. rufescens than L. natalensis, the normal snail host of the strain of F. gigantica. Evidence from the dissection of whole snails and from the examination of tissue sections indicates that the number and sizes of sporocysts developing in the two species of snails are comparable but that there is considerable difference in the development of the rediae. Dissection of snails shows a decreasing incidence of sporocysts of the xiphidiocercaria.},

Reduction in life expectancy and reproductive capacity have previously been documented in Fasciola gigantica-infected Lymnaea ollula, but the influence of the endocrine system on this specific host–parasite interaction has not been previously examined. In the present study, we observed survival, growth pattern, and reproductive output of L. ollula following exposure to F. gigantica. Both the survival and the growth pattern of infected snails were similar to those of the non-infected control group. However, a significant difference was apparent in fecundity, as infected snails consistently showed lower levels of egg and embryo production throughout a 7-wk observation period. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR also revealed down-regulation of estrogen receptor expression in infected snails during the first 4 wk of infection. Nonetheless, the inhibition of estrogen signaling was transient, as they regained expression in the later phase of infection. It is, therefore, suggested that other hormones of the complex endocrine system may be involved in the reduced fecundity of L. ollula following F. gigantica infection.},

  abstract = {The present article reports the larval development of Fasciola gigantica in its snail host under laboratory conditions. The morphology of each stage is described in detail, and also its bionomics studied. Further investigations are made on the epidemiology of fascioliasis of cattle in Tsinchiang region, South Fukien with a view to obtain more precise information on different aspects of the problem.The segmentation of egg was arrested during the cold season of the year and was resumed at the beginning of the spring. At room temperature of 28°-35℃, mass hatching occurred after 10-14 days of incubation. Development of eggs was completely inhibited below 9℃, and at 38℃. The optimum temperature for the development was found to be 25°-30℃, but a temperature of 45°-50℃ was lethal. It was found that none of eggs could withstand drying for more than 10 minutes after exposure to air.The miracidium of Fasciola gigantica is covered with twenty-one ciliary epidermal cells arranged in five transverse rows of 6, 6, 3, 4 and 2 respectively. There are two distinct cells lying at the posterior lateral end of the germ ball which had not been hitherto revealed by former workers. These cells with numerous granules in the cytoplasm are presumably excretory in function.In summer time when the room temperature rises to 26°-34℃, the mature sporocyst with a single redia was recovered in snail host 10 days after exposure to miracidia. The mature mother redia from sporocyst may be obtained from the infected snails dissected 15 days after infection. On 30-32 days after exposure to miracidia, fully developed daughter rediae were found to contain mature cercariae, cercarial embryos and a few germ balls. The arrangements of flame cells and fine tubules in the cercaria and encysted metacercaria were carefully studied. Our observation indicated that there are only 12 pairs of flame cells but not 32 pairs as reported for F. hepatica by Faust (1932). Thus, the formula for the cercaria of F. gigantica can be expressed as 2[(2 + 2 + 2) + (2 + 2 + 2)] = 24.Bcologic factors, such as temperature, light and aquatic medium were found to have effect on the emergence of cercariae. During the cold season of the year at the low temperature of 9°-14℃, the emergence was entirely inhibited. The optimum range of temperature for the emergence was found to be 20°-25℃. Within this range a large number of cercariae escaped from snails in the dark night more likely at hours before dawn, and only few cercariae appeared at the different times of the day. After emergence from snails, the cercariae ascend to near the surface of water. The majority of cercariae eneysted within a distance of 3 cm to the surface. Only few cercariae encysted at various depths.There arc three species of lymnaeid snails, such as Lymnaea (Radix) auricularia, L. (R.) swinhoei and L. (Fossaria) ollida collected in Foochow. Experiments were conducted to study the susceptibility of these snails to infection with the miracidia of Fasciola gigantiea. Results of experiments clearly indicated that only one species, L. (F.) ollida, was highly susceptible (infective rate: 58.95-76.41\%) in both young and adult, while the other two species, L. (R.) auricularia and L. (R.) swinhoei can not be experimentally infected with F. gigantiea. L. (F.) ollula which, according to our previous studies (Lin 1956, 1962), also acted as the intermediate host of F. hepatica. The habitat of this snail is semi-aquatic and similar to that of L. truneatula. According to Abbott (1948), this snail has two synonyms, L. pervia and L. philippinensis. L. pervia has been reported to occur widely over the whole China and Japan and acted as the intermediate host of F. hepatica (Shirai 1925). L. philippinensis was recorded as the important vector of both F. hepatica and F. gigantiea in Philippine islands (Jesus 1937).In view of results obtained from previous workers and those of our own, it can be deduced that F. hepatica and F. gigantiea were not clearly seperated by their respective snails as suggested by Kendall (1954, 1959).

  abstract = {Fasciolosis, caused by the liver fluke Fasciola spp., is a significant parasitic disease of livestock and humans worldwide. Fasciola transmission and life cycle are highly dependent on climatic conditions, especially temperature and humidity. This dependency has gained significance in the context of ongoing climate change. This literature review examined evidence on the effects of temperature variability on the developmental stages of Fasciola spp. and the snail intermediate hosts. We reviewed free larval stages of Fasciola spp. development, as well as snail intermediate hosts, while investigating the climate-related factors influencing each stage. We found that Fasciola spp. egg hatching and development were inhibited below 10 °C and optimal between 20 and 30 °C, miracidia hatching time decreased with higher temperatures and cercarial shedding by snail hosts accelerated around 27 °C. Further, metacercarial viability declined at higher temperatures but was prolonged by higher humidity. Snail intermediate host growth rates peaked at 25 °C, and their susceptibility to Fasciola infection depends on temperature, underscoring its importance in transmission dynamics. Overall, the Fasciola life cycle and snail host development exhibit stage-specific temperature thresholds, indicating a complex relationship between temperature fluctuations and parasite transmission potential. This research highlights the key role of temperature and humidity on Fasciola spp. and snail development, shedding light on the potential consequences of climate change on their survival, development, and disease transmission. Data limitations, primarily from the scarcity of high-resolution climate-related experiments, should drive future research to enhance predictive models and deepen our understanding of the impact of climate change on this parasitic disease.},

  abstract = {In this paper the main ecological components of selected animal trematode infection cycles are considered with regard to the possibilities of control. The geographical distributions of Fasciola hepatica, F. gigantica, Paramphistomum microbothrium, Schistosoma bovis and S. mattheei are compared in relation to the distribution patterns of their snail intermediate hosts. In order to constitute an effective lifecycle host, intermediate host and the eggs and freeliving stages of the parasite overlap in the effective biotope. Comparing the biotopes of the different trematodiases it becomes evident that they have much in common particularly as the snail intermediate hosts occupy identical niches in a food-chain in which the pollution by the host species results in abundant food for the snail. Moreover, the physical activaties of herbivores, e.g. trampling down the turf, create favourable habitats for the intermediate host. The dynamic nature of the freshwater snail habitats characteristic for trematodiasis, regularly results in a complete disappearance of the effective biotopes in the field. With regard to the parasite these effects are overcome by a long life-expectancy of egg producing parasites in the host population. Small scale changes in availability of appropriate hosts for successful cercarial establishment are compensated by the extended period of cercarial shedding from the snail population. These features in combination with the survival of eggs and the grazing and drinking behaviour characteristics of the hosts tend to stabilize the potential oscillations in transmission rate. Because of the complicated nature of interdependency within the host-trematode-intermediate host complex, the ecological base with regard to practical measures is fundamentally wide. However, the pressure upon the situation by social and economic conditions limits operative possibilities considerably.},

Fresh eggs from the gall bladder of water buffaloes fully developed into embryonated ones and hatched out at days 11-12 after incubation at about 29ºC. Free-swimming miracidia rapidly penetrated into the snail host, and gradually developed into the next larval stages; sporocyst, redia, and daughter redia with cercariae. Fully-developed cercariae were separated from the redia and shed from the snails on day 39 post-infection (PI). Free-swimming cercariae were immediately allowed to adhere to rice plants, and capsules were constructed to protect metacercariae on rice plants. Juvenile worms were detected in intestines of mice at days 3 and 6 PI, but they were found in the bile duct from day 9 PI. Juvenile and adult flukes were recovered from 16 mice experimentally infected with metacercariae, with the average recovery rate of 35.8\%. Sexually mature adult flukes were recovered from day 42 PI. It could be confirmed that experimentally encysted metacercariae could infect and develop to maturity in the experimental host. The present study reports for the first time the complete life history of F. gigantica by an experimental study in Thailand. The obtained information can be used as a guide for prevention, elimination, and treatment of F. gigantica at environment and in other hosts.},

The results were compared with those of control snails infected according to the same protocol and always maintained at 20~°C. Compared to controls, a significant increase in the number of cercariae-shedding snails, a significantly longer patent period and significantly greater cercarial production were noted in temperature-challenged snails, regardless of the type of digenean infection. In contrast, the number of incompletely formed metacercariae was significantly higher in temperature-challenged snails than in controls. Incompletely formed metacercariae of F. hepatica consisted of cysts whose colour remained whitish after shedding (25.4\% for temperature-challenged snails) or whose dome was flattened after encystment (74.6\%). Those of P. daubneyi were totally dark brown or blackish after formation. These incomplete metacercariae might originate from young differentiating cercariae within the snail body (F. hepatica) or from cercariae which died just after encystment (P. daubneyi). The use of regular temperature changes for snails infected with F. hepatica or P. daubneyi must be monitored carefully during collection of metacercariae to select completely formed cysts for infecting definitive hosts.},

In contrary, Patent periods were significantly affected by the intensity of miracidial infection. Temperature above 24�C was suitable for high metacercarial production and a significant increasing in the percentage of the floating metacercariae was found at high temperature.

  title = {Predicting Temporal Changes in {{Fasciola}} Hepatica Abundance from Climatic Variables},
  author = {Smith, Daniel Barnaby},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Fasciola hepatica is an economically important parasite of sheep and cattle. The life cycle of this parasite includes freeliving stages and an intermediate snail host (Galba truncatula). In the past, several statistical models have been developed to predict how climatic factors, specifically temperature and rainfall, affect parasite abundance. However, these models were built under historic climate conditions, or for a specific geographic region, and are not well suited to predict how the epidemiology of infection might change in situations of global climatic change. The primary objective of the work described in this thesis was to develop a mathematical model of the life cycle of Fasciola hepatica that, for the first time, captures the seasonality of the parasite and can be used to predict parasite abundance under the varying conditions of climate change and alterations in farm management practices. To build the model, experimental studies were conducted to increase the available data on parasite development and survival in the environment. The experimental work focused on the effects of temperature and water availability on parasite eggs and metacercarial development and survival. The survival of parasites at low temperatures suggests that overwintering of parasites on pasture is very possible. The differential equation model developed focused solely on the freeliving stages of F. hepatica and runs on daily temperature and rainfall (rainy day) data. The model was validated against data from published longitudinal studies and passive disease surveillance data. The limited data available to validate this type of model made it impossible to validate the model in a sufficiently robust manner. From the validation studies, it appears that the model is good at predicting the seasonality of the parasite but performs less well at predicting differences in peak abundance between years. The model predicts that, under two different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, the abundance of F. hepatica will increase dramatically in future, with more than twice the number of metacercariae currently seen between August and October, and significantly more pasture contamination between June and December. The effects of dosing animals at different times of the year was also investigated, Under historic conditions, in the United Kingdom, a single dose of an appropriate helmintic treatment administered to animals in March will not reduce the number of metacercariae seen in the autumn, but a significant reduction results if an appropriate anthelmintic is administered in May. Greater metacercariae pasture contamination predicted under future climate projections will necessitate changes in farm management practices aimed at limiting transmission, which is predicted to occur earlier in the year. i},

The effect of long-term exposure of Lymnaea natalensis to 0.1μg/l, 10μg/l, or 100μg/l cadmium (Cd) on the infection rates with F. gigantica, percentage of cercariae-shedding snails and cercariae shedding pattern was investigated. The snails were exposed to Cd for 7 days either pre-infection with single Fasciola miracidium or during the late pre-patent period of the infection. The possible interaction between metal exposure and acclimatization temperature was also studied in three ranges; 16–18°C, 23–25°C and 30–32°C. Results clearly showed that host exposure to 100μg/l Cd significantly affected the pattern of Fasciola development inside its snail host, and that the acclimatization temperature was a key factor affecting the role played by Cd. Pre-infection exposure to Cd caused a significant reduction in the infection rates where the effect was temperature-dependent. Post-infection exposure to Cd significantly increased the percentage of cercariae-shedding snails; the effect was temperature-independent. Interestingly, post-infection exposure significantly altered the differential cercarial output pattern, while no clear impact on the total was found. The alteration in the differential cercarial output was represented as a significantly higher proportion of floating metacercaria as compared to fixed ones and also higher proportion of dead cercariae which may directly reduce the transmission of Fasciola to the final host. The mechanisms of cadmium impact are briefly discussed.},

Failure of most eggs to hatch at 28.0\textsuperscript{⚬}C., although development took place up to the prehatching stage, suggests that increased use of stored food in the egg left insufficient energy available for the radular movements necessary to hatching.

Snails kept at 32.0\textsuperscript{⚬} and 36.0\textsuperscript{⚬}C. died in the first week; those kept at 11.5\textsuperscript{⚬}C. grew very little, and those at lower temperatures not at all.},

  abstract = {Groups of the snail Lymnaea truncatula, maintained at a range of spatial densities, were exposed to different densities of miracidia of Fasciola hepatica. The resulting degree of parasitization was measured 3–4 weeks after infection. The relationship between parasite densities and parasitization appeared to be curvilinear. The lower than expected parasitization at high parasite densities could be explained by the multiple infection of some snails by two or more miracidia.The level of parasitization was not related exponentially to the temperature at which infection was carried out. This was thought to be due to the inverse relationship between miracidial longevity and swimming speed, with respect to temperature. A depth of free water overlying a mud surface was an absolute requirement for miracidia to successfully infect snails.},
